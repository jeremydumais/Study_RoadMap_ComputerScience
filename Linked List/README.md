# Linked List

## Single Linked List

The single linked list is composed of a head pointer to the first Node of the
list.

If the list is empty, the head points to nil.

A node is composed of a value (a string in our implementation) and a next value
which points to the next node. You navigate in the list starting from the head
to the last node through the next pointer. When next equals nil it means that
you have reach the last node.

See the [SingleLinkedList README](https://github.com/jeremydumais/Study_RoadMap_ComputerScience/blob/main/Linked%20List/singlelinkedlist/README.md)
for the demo implementation details.

## Double Linked List

The double linked list is composed of a head pointer to the first Node of the
list and with a tail pointer to the last Node of the list.

If the list is empty, the head and tail points to nil.

A node is composed of a value (a string in our implementation), a next value
which points to the next node and a prev value which points to the previous 
node. You navigate in the list either by starting from the head to the last node
through the next pointer or by starting from the tail to the first node through
the prev pointer. When next equals nil it means that you have reach the last 
node. The same way when prev equals nil it means that you have reach the first
node.
