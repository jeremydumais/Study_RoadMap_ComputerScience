# Linked List

## Single Linked List

The single linked list is composed of a head pointer to the first Node of the
list.

If the list is empty, the head points to nil.

A node is composed of a value (a string in our implementation) and a next value
which points to the next node. You navigate in the list starting from the head
to the last node through the next pointer. When next equals nil it means that
you have reach the last node.

See the [SingleLinkedList README](https://github.com/jeremydumais/Study_RoadMap_ComputerScience/blob/main/Linked%20List/singlelinkedlist/README.md)
for the demo implementation details.
